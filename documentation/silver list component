Passing functions across children and parents in typescript require some extra steps.
An interface has to be declared with void, and React.FC<> also has to be added in the const.

``` typescript
interface SilverListProps {
    handleCreateItem: () => void;
}

const SilverList: React.FC<SilverListProps> = ({ handleCreateItem }) => {...}
```
