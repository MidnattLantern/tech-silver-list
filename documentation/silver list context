Context that is accessible globaly across silver list
Context is a DRY approach and portable approach, to allow components pass data remotely, rather than repeating and passing data across parents and children.

Silver List use UUID
``` bash
npm install uuid
```
because of Typescript
``` bash
npm install @types/uuid --save-dev
```

Any context provider, such as silverListContext need to wrap <App /> inside index.tsx so that it can be accessible across the entire app. Like this:
```javascript
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <SilverListProvider>
      <App />
    </SilverListProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Currently, the array hold an id and a name. More items can be added depending on needs.

silverListArray retrieve the array.
setSilverListArray is the link to CRUD actions.
addSilverListItem create an item. UUID is not provided by this context component.

Interface for creating,
Interface for erasing,
Interface for holding a current item by index,
Interface for selecting,

holdSilverListArrayIndex is different from holdSilverListItem, as it keep track of the array
